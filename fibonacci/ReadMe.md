Fibonacci Series

This series can be broken down as the following series: 
Fib0 = 0 
Fib1 = 1 
Fibn = Fibn-1 + Fibn-2 , n > 1

First few elements of Fibonacci series are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377...

You are given a list of non-negative integers. For each integer, n, in the list print nth fibonacci number modulo 108+7.

Input Format 
The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test-cases. T lines follow, each representing a test case. In each line there is a non-negative integer, n.

Output Format 
For each test case, print Fibn % (108+7).

Constraints 
1 <= T <= 104 
0 <= n <= 104
